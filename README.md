# my-super-scripts

This repository contains a collection of my personal scripts – useful tools,
automations, and solutions to various problems I've encountered.
You'll find everything from simple one-off utilities to more complex projects.

## Repository Structure

Each script is organized in a separate file or folder,
often with a brief description and usage example.

## Technologies

Most of the scripts are written in:

- `Bash`
- `Python`

## Usage

Most scripts are ready to run without installation.
You’ll find usage instructions inside each script or its
corresponding folder if needed.

```bash
python3 script_name.py
```

or

```bash
./script_name.sh
```
